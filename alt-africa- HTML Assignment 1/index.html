    <!--The second section will be on my Biography. Who I am-->
    <section>
        <h2>BIOGRAPHY:</h2> <br>
        <p>I am a graduate of Law seeking to transition into backend engineering. As the firstborn of three children, I was the test run for whether a federal school is a good idea or not. My interest in problem-solving, combined with a growing curiosity about technology, has inspired me to pursue backend development.
            During my time at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), I was consistently among the top 5% of my class, an achievement that reflects my strong analytical skills and commitment to excellence. 
            Although my academic background is in law, I have always enjoyed tackling challenges and finding practical solutions. Recently, I began exploring backend systems, databases, and APIs, and I am eager to deepen my understanding in these areas. 
            The skills I developed through my legal studies, such as critical thinking, attention to detail, and structured analysis, will be invaluable as I develop my technical abilities.
            I am now transitioning into backend engineering, applying my problem-solving skills and attention to detail in this new field. Although I am at the beginning of this journey, I am committed to learning and developing the necessary skills to contribute meaningfully to the field of technology.</p>

    <!--The third section is on the reason why I choose ALT School-->
    <section>
        <h2>WHY I JOINED ALT SCHOOL</h2> <br>

    <p>There are countless reasons I chose to join Alt School,and due to how inexhaustible they might seem, I can't name them all. However, I'll try to highlight some of the most important ones. My journey from law to backend engineering is an unconventional one, but ALT School provides the perfect bridge for this transition. I was drawn to this program because it offers:</p> <br>

    <ol>
        <li>A structured pathway into backend engineering, making the transition smoother for someone with no prior technical background.</li> <br>
        <li>A curriculum that breaks down complex concepts into digestible lessons, allowing me to build a solid foundation from the ground up.</li> <br>
        <li>An opportunity to apply my problem-solving and analytical skills in a new, technical space.</li> <br>
        <li>A strong focus on structure and logical thinking—skills I developed during my legal studies and now want to refine in a more technical field.</li> <br>
        <li>The chance to merge my legal research and structured analysis abilities with backend development, creating a unique approach to problem-solving.</li> <br>
        <li>A hands-on learning experience that prioritizes real-world application over just theory, helping me gain practical skills.</li> <br>
        <li>The flexibility to fully immerse myself in this transition, ensuring I get the most out of the program.</li> <br>
        <li>A dynamic and supportive community that encourages collaboration, peer learning, and mentorship—essential for growth in any new field.</li> <br>
    </ol> <br>

    <p>For someone like me, who thrives on structure and enjoys figuring out how things work, ALT School is the ideal place to start this journey
